A course i'm following @ Fontys Hogescholen

Learning targets:

- Use algoritmic insight in solving programming puzzle problems, by writing and reading java code.
- Reduce programming effort and increase performance by reusing and switching implementations of data structures and algorithms; avoid ArrayList/arrays were possible.
- Analyse existing code on execution and memory complexity, by understanding how the data structures work and how the input size influences the execution steps
- Validate your scalability using Unit tests
